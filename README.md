My Name is Salim Dziri and this is my first published small website that i built while still learning, it uses 000webhosting for hosting backend so it might be a little laggy and probably cannot hold many user.
The design is mostly suitable for mobile screen, but i tried my best to make it look good in desktop screen as well
